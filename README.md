# PR_automater
The system listens to GitHub webhooks to manage PR queues and post updates to Slack and Discord. It prioritizes the oldest issues, ensuring they're addressed before new ones, but allows overrides when needed. By reminding reviewers of pending PRs in a prioritized queue, it prevents delays and improves workflow efficiency.
